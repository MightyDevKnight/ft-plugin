# Typography / Body

Body is a typography component used to create various levels of hierarchies between text.

export const BodyDefault = args => {
  return html`
    <div style="padding: 10%; justify-content: center; gap:16px;">
      <sux-body .size="${args.size}" .classification="${args.classification}">
        From the design point of view, each component has a number of options. These options and their names are platform agnostic, and each implementation should adapt these to
        fit into their framework.
      </sux-body>
    </div>
  `;
};

## Table of options / API

From the design point of view, each component has a number of options. These options and their names are platform agnostic, and each implementation should adapt these to fit into their framework.
